We do this by connecting our users with independent medical practitioners who offer a virtual cardiometabolic health program that helps our users manage their weight, blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and tobacco use from home with confidence.

Miga provides its users with the ability to obtain telemedicine consultations provided by independent medical practitioners including, but not limited to, Park Hill Health Services, P.A., Richard Joseph, M.D., P.C., and Park Hill Health Services of New Jersey, P.C. (collectively &quot;Medical Group&quot;), an independent medical group with a network of United States-based health care providers (each, a &quot;Provider&quot;). Medical Group (or your own medical provider if you do not use a Medical Group Provider) is responsible for providing you with a Notice of Privacy Practices describing its collection and use of your health information, not Miga.</p><h3>Key Terms &amp; Definitions and Our Privacy Policy</h3><p>It is helpful to start by explaining some of our key terms and definitions used in this Privacy Policy:</p><ul role="list"><li>Our &quot;Devices&quot; - Miga devices compatible with our Platform</li><li>&quot;Personal Information&quot; - Any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual</li><li>and any information listed below</li><li>Our &quot;Platform&quot; - Our Website and Devices</li><li>&quot;Privacy Policy&quot; - This privacy policy</li><li>&quot;Products&quot; - Any products available for purchase on our Platform</li><li>Our &quot;Services&quot; - Any services provided through our Platform</li><li>Our &quot;Terms of Service&quot; - Our terms of service located <a href="https://miga-dot-com-legal.s3.amazonaws.com/terms.html">here</a></li><li>Our &quot;Website(s)&quot; - Our websites, including: www.migahealth.com</li><li>&quot;Miga,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot; - Enduring Management Services, LLC</li></ul><p><strong>When does our Privacy Policy apply?</strong></p><p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you when:</p><ul role="list"><li>You visit or use our Platform, including our Website;</li><li>You wear our Devices and record Personal Information;</li><li>We communicate via e-mail and through text; and</li><li>We communicate in person, such as on the phone or through a telehealth visit.</li></ul><p><strong>When does our Privacy Policy not apply?</strong></p><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by any other website operated either by us or by a third party, unless the website is listed above or links to this Privacy Policy.
