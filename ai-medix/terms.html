Your acceptance of, and compliance with, these Terms of Use is a condition to your use of the following:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="index.html">www.migahealth.com</a> (our &quot;Website&quot;);</li><li>Our Platform compatible devices (our &quot;Devices&quot;);</li><li>Any products (&quot;Products&quot;) available for purchase through our Website; and</li><li>The services (&quot;Services&quot;) made available through our Website and Devices.</li></ul><p>The non-medical business support services, our Website and Devices, are collectively referred to as our &quot;Platform.&quot;</p><p>Miga contracts with Park Hill Health Services, P.A., Richard Joseph, M.D., P.C., and Park Hill Health Services of New Jersey, P.C. (collectively &quot;Medical Group&quot;), which is an independent medical group with a network of United States based health care providers (each, a &quot;Provider&quot;) to provide online telehealth clinical consultations, services, and/or treatment. The professional medical services provided by Medical Group through the use of our Platform are collectively referred to in this Terms of Use as the &quot;Services.&quot;</p><p>Miga is not a medical group and does not provide medical advice, care, and/or treatment. Miga provides administrative and management services to independent, physician-owned and operated, medical practices. Any telemedicine consults obtained through our Platform are provided by Medical Group Providers. Miga licenses the &quot;Miga&quot; brand name to Medical Group and other affiliated medical practices that use our Platform to assist in the provision of Services. Each Miga-branded practice is owned and operated by a licensed physician and is not owned and operated by Miga. There is no single provider of medical care called &quot;Miga.&quot; Each Miga-branded practice engages a network of United States based clinicians who provide clinical telehealth services on behalf of the independent medical practice and not on behalf of Miga. The Providers deliver clinical services via the Platform to their patients, in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Miga does not provide medical advice or care, own or operate the medical practices, nor employ or in any way supervise the clinicians providing medical care. Control over the care provided is the sole responsibility of the independent medical practices and the Providers they employ. Services and practices may vary across Providers, and patients should contact the Providers at Medical Group directly for all questions concerning their medical care.</p><p>By clicking &quot;Accept,&quot; you acknowledge that you have read in its entirety, understand, and fully accept all terms and conditions contained in these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, and the Notice of Privacy Practices provided to you by Medical Group. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to access or use our Platform and/or the Services; PROMPTLY EXIT THIS WEBSITE.</p><p>Binding Arbitration. These Terms of Use provide that all disputes between you and Miga that in any way relate to these Terms of Use, the Platform, and/or the Services will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT (INCLUDING IN A CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING) to assert or defend your rights under these Terms of Use. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with Miga.</p><h3>Services Provided - No Medical Care or Advice</h3><h3>Not For Emergencies</h3><p>Our Platform and the Services are not for medical emergencies or urgent situations. You should not disregard or delay seeking medical advice based on anything that appears or does not appear on our Platform. If you believe you are experiencing an emergency, call 9-1-1 immediately.</p><p>You should seek emergency help or follow up care when recommended by a Provider or when otherwise needed. You should continue to consult with your primary provider and other healthcare professionals as recommended. Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider concerning questions you have regarding a medical condition and before stopping, starting, or modifying any treatment.</p><h3>Risk of Telehealth Services</h3><p>By using the Services, you acknowledge the potential risks associated with telehealth services. These include but are not limited to the following: information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical or healthcare decision making by the Provider; delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of electronic equipment; a lack of access to your medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors; although the electronic systems we use incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, those protocols could fail causing a breach of privacy of your health information.</p><h3>Privacy Practices</h3><p>You agree that information provided by you in connection with the Platform and the Services shall be governed by the Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated and made part of these Terms of Use. You also agree that information provided by you in connection with the Services shall also be governed by the applicable Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices, and is hereby incorporated and made part of these Terms of Use.</p><h3>Prescription Policy</h3><p>Certain products available through the Platform require a valid prescription by a licensed healthcare provider. You will not be able to obtain a prescription product unless you have completed a consultation with one of the Providers through the Platform, the Provider has determined the prescription product is appropriate for you, and the Provider has written a prescription.</p><p>If a Provider determines a prescription product is appropriate for you and writes a prescription, you may fill the prescription at any pharmacy of your choice as prompted during your use of the Services.</p><p>You agree that any prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider will be solely for your personal use. You agree to fully and carefully read all provided product information and labels and to contact a physician or pharmacist if you have any questions regarding the prescription. We fully honor patient freedom of choice and, if you receive a prescription for a medication, you always have the option to instruct your Provider to transmit that prescription to the pharmacy of your choice.</p><h3>Not an Insurance Product</h3><p>We are not an insurer, nor do we offer an insurance plan or product.

To simplify the user experience on the Platform, you are able to pay for your purchases via the Platform with Miga serving as payment processing agent on your behalf. If you elect to purchase a Service from Medical Group, then the total price you pay includes the amount charged by Medical Group for the Service. We collect the amounts charged by Medical Group on your behalf and pass through such charges to the Medical Group. Before making a purchase, you will see an itemized invoice listing the actual charges by Medical Group for the Services.</p><p><strong>Subscription and Payment Terms</strong></p><p>If you purchase a subscription to our Platform and/or Services, your subscription is continuous and will be automatically renewed at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by Contacting Us. If you cancel your subscription, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. Miga may change the price for your Platform subscription, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Platform after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing prior to the price change going into effect.</p><p>We accept credit and debit cards issued by U.S. banks. If a credit card account is being used for a transaction, we may obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the payment. If you enroll to make recurring payments automatically, all charges and fees will be billed to the credit card you designate during the setup process. If you want to designate a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card, you must change your information online. This may temporarily delay your ability to make online payments while we verify your new payment information.</p><p>You represent and warrant that if you are making online payments that (a) any credit card, debit card, and bank account information you supply is true, correct, and complete, (b) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit/debit card company or bank, (c) you will pay the charges incurred by you in the amounts posted, including, without limitation, any applicable taxes, and (d) you are the person in whose name the card was issued and you are authorized to make a purchase or other transaction with the relevant credit card and credit card information. If we are unable to secure funds from the payment method you provide for any reason, including insufficient funds in the payment method or insufficient or inaccurate information provided by you when submitting electronic payment, we may undertake further collection action, including application of fees to the extent permitted by law. You acknowledge and agree that you will not dispute the charges from Miga, Medical Group, or any third party payment processor with the payment method company, provided the transactions correspond to the terms indicated in these Terms of Use.</p><p><strong>Visit Cancellation / No Show Policy and Fee</strong></p><p>When you schedule an appointment with Miga, we set aside enough time to provide you with the highest quality care. Should you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment, please contact us as soon as possible, and no later than 24 hours prior to your scheduled appointment. This gives us time to schedule other patients who may be waiting for an appointment. Any patient who fails to show or cancels/reschedules an appointment and has not contacted our office with at least 24 hours notice will be considered a No Show and charged a cancellation fee.  </p><h3>Order Acceptance</h3><p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason, at our sole discretion. For your convenience, you will not be charged until your payment method is authorized, the order information is verified for accuracy and your order is shipped. Some situations that may result in your order being canceled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge.</p><h3>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h3><p>You may cancel or obtain a refund for Products purchased on the Platform in accordance with our Cancellation and Refund Policy.</p><h3>Links to Other Sites</h3><p>We make no representations whatsoever about any other website that you may access through the Platform.

Miga, Medical Group, and your Provider may contact you by telephone, mail, or e-mail to verify your information. Miga, Medical Group, and your Provider may request further information from you and you agree to provide such further information to ensure that you have not fraudulently used the Platform.

You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services.

In the event of a conflict between the supplemental terms and any other terms herein, the supplemental terms shall prevail.</p><p>To be a healthcare provider using the Platform (for purposes of this Section, &quot;Provider&quot; or &quot;you&quot;), you must be a licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or healthcare professional contracted or employed by the Medical Group, and must agree to comply with all laws, medical board rules, and other rules and regulations applicable to you as a Provider or otherwise. Your relationship with the Miga users (including, but not limited to, your Medical Group patients) is directly between you and the patient. The patient will never have a physician-patient relationship with Miga. Miga does not practice medicine and offers no medical services. As set forth more fully below, Provider is solely responsible for all agreements, consents, notices, and other interactions with patients and other consumers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Provider and Miga are each responsible for all billings and collections from patients and other consumers, and Miga shall have no liability whatsoever to Provider with respect to any amounts owed by any patient or other consumer to Provider.</p><p>We do not provide any medical advice, legal advice, or representations in any way regarding any legal or medical issues associated with Provider, goods, or services offered by Provider, including but not limited to any compliance obligations or steps necessary to comply with any state or federal laws and regulations. Provider should seek legal counsel regarding any legal and compliance issues and should not rely on any materials or content associated with the Platform in determining Provider’s compliance obligations under the law. Provider and Miga agree that Miga is not providing to customers, patients, or anyone else, medical advice, or legal advice. THE PLATFORM IS NOT MEANT TO SUBSTITUTE OR MODIFY YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN ANY WAY.</p><p>Provider will use the Platform only in accordance with applicable standards of good medical practice. While software products such as the Platform can facilitate and improve the quality of service that Provider can offer patients, many factors, including but not limited to the provider/patient relationship, can affect a patient’s outcome, and with intricate and interdependent technologies and complex decision-making, it is often difficult or impossible to accurately determine what the factors were and in what proportion they affected an outcome. Provider will advise patients, when reasonably necessary, that Services provided through the Platform may not be a complete or adequate substitute for in-person assessments by the Provider. Provider shall be solely responsible for its use of the Platform and the provision of medical services to Provider’s patients. In this regard, Provider releases Miga and waives any and all potential claims against Miga as a result of Provider’s use of the Platform and the provision of Services to Provider’s patients.</p><p>As a result of the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the patient care process, Provider agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Miga harmless from any claim by or on behalf of any patient of Provider, or by or on behalf of any other third party or person claiming damage by virtue of a familial or financial relationship with such a patient, which is brought against Miga, regardless of the cause if such claim arises for any reason whatsoever, out of Provider’s use or operation of the Platform. To the extent applicable, Provider will obtain Miga’s prior written consent to any settlement or judgment in which Provider agrees to any finding of fault of Miga or defect in the Platform. Miga will promptly notify Provider in writing of any claim subject to this indemnification, promptly provide Provider with the information reasonably required for the defense of the same, and grant to Provider exclusive control over its defense and settlement.</p><p>If you submit, upload, transmit, or post any consents, notices, advice, recommendations, comments, files, videos, images, or other materials to us or our Platform (&quot;Provider Content&quot;) or provide any Provider Content to patients or other consumers, you agree not to provide any Provider Content that (a) is defamatory, abusive, libelous, unlawful, obscene, threatening, harassing, fraudulent, pornographic, or harmful, or that could encourage criminal or unethical behavior, (b) violates or infringes the privacy, copyright, trademark, trade dress, trade secrets, or intellectual property rights of any person or entity, or (c) contains or transmits a virus or any other harmful component. Provider is solely responsible for obtaining all necessary agreements and consents from, and providing all required notices to, patients and other consumers. You agree not to contact other users through unsolicited e-mails, telephone calls, mailings, or any other method of communication. You represent and warrant to Miga that you have the legal right and authorization to upload all Provider Content to the Platform. Miga shall have a royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable right, and license to use the Provider Content however Miga desires, including without limitation, to copy, modify, delete in its entirety, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from or sell or distribute such Provider Content or incorporate such Provider Content into any form, medium, or technology throughout the world, provided, however, that such use does not interfere or control the Provider’s clinical judgment or constitute the practice of medicine. Miga is and shall be under no obligation: (i) to maintain any Provider Content in confidence; (ii) to pay to you any compensation for any Provider Content; or (iii) to respond to any Provider Content.</p><p>Miga does not regularly review Provider Content, but does reserve the right (but not the obligation) to monitor and edit or remove any Provider Content submitted to the Platform. You grant Miga the right to use the name that you submit in connection with any Provider Content. You agree not to use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any Provider Content. You are and shall remain solely responsible for the content of any Provider Content you post to the Platform or provide to patients or other consumers. Miga and its affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Provider Content submitted by you or any third party.</p><h3>No Third Party Rights</h3><p>Unless expressly stated in these Terms of Use, nothing herein is intended to confer any rights, obligations, duties, or remedies, on any person other than you, Miga, Medical Group, and their affiliates. Nothing in the Terms of Use is intended to relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any third persons to you, Miga, Medical Group, and its affiliates, nor shall any provision give any third parties any right of subrogation or action over against you, Miga, Medical Group, and its affiliates. The Platform is only provided for your benefit and may not be relied on by any third party.</p><h3>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement</h3><p>We will try to work in good faith to resolve any issue you have with the Platform, including Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Platform, if you bring that issue to the attention of our customer service department. However, we realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a user’s satisfaction.</p><p>You and Miga agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms of Use or your use of the Platform, including Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Platform, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than bringing a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in court, however, we agree to cooperate with each other to agree to reasonable discovery in light of the issues involved and amount of the claim. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, but in so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the matter had been brought in court, including without limitation, the law on punitive damages as applied by the United States Supreme Court. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Miga are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use and any other contractual relationship between you and Miga.</p><p>If you desire to assert a claim against Miga, and you therefore elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Miga, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice to Miga should be addressed to: Enduring Management Services, LLC, Attn: LEGAL NOTICE, 548 Market St PMB 50727, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401(&quot;Notice Address&quot;). If Miga desires to assert a claim against you and therefore elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Miga, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;Demand&quot;). If Miga and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Miga may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Miga or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Any arbitration brought under this section shall be brought in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees, and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You and Miga agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Products, Platform, Services, or this Agreement must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. You understand that, in return for agreement to this provision, Miga is able to offer the Service at the terms designated, and that your assent to this provision is an indispensable consideration to this Agreement.</p><p>YOU AND Miga AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Miga agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&#x27;s individual claim.</p><p>If this Agreement to Arbitrate provision is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts located in and for Delaware. Both Miga and you agree to waive any and all rights to a jury trial in the event this agreement to arbitrate is found to be unenforceable.</p><h3>Indemnification</h3><p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Miga and any affiliates harmless from and against any and all rights, demands, losses, liabilities, damages, claims, causes of action, actions, and suits (no matter whether at law or equity), fees, costs, and attorney’s fees of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with: (i) your use or misuse of the Platform, Products, Services, or any information posted on the Platform; (ii) your breach of the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy; (iii) the content or subject matter of any information you provide to Miga, Medical Group, your Provider, or a customer service agent; or (iv) any negligent or wrongful act or omission by you in your use or misuse of the Platform, Products, Services, or any information on the Platform, including without limitation, infringement of third party intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or negligent or wrongful conduct.</p><h3>Disclaimer of Warranties</h3><p>Miga DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PLATFORM WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE PLATFORM WILL BE CORRECTED.

Miga DOES NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF THE INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE PLATFORM.</p><p>YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM, PLATFORM-RELATED SERVICES, SERVICES, AND LINKED WEBSITES. Miga DOES NOT WARRANT THAT FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES, WORMS, TROJAN HORSES, OR OTHER DESTRUCTIVE PROGRAMMING. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY YOUR NEEDS FOR DATA BACK UP AND SECURITY.</p><p>WARRANTIES RELATING TO PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED, SOLD, AND DISTRIBUTED BY Miga ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IF ANY, PROVIDED WITH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPLICABLE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.</p><h3>Limitation of Liability Regarding Use of Platform and Services</h3><p>Miga AND ANY THIRD PARTIES MENTIONED ON THIS PLATFORM ARE NEITHER RESPONSIBLE NOR LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE PLATFORM, PLATFORM-RELATED SERVICES, SERVICE, CONTENT, OR INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THE PLATFORM, AND/OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

We will do our best to communicate with you and to provide notice within thirty (30) days of the Force Majeure Event, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. We shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized.
